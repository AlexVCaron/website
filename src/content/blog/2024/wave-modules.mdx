## Fun Features

<!-- Free wins? -->

### Update container environments on the fly

```nextflow
process {
    withName: 'STAR_ALIGN' {
        conda "bioconda::star=2.6.1d bioconda::samtools=1.16.1 conda-forge::gawk=5.1.0"
    }
}
```

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -with-wave
```

Boom a aws-igenomes compatible container for the process. You may need to patch the modules if you're changing the version too much.

### Pipeline module patches

In the above example pipeline maintainers will be able to more easily update crucial versions inside the module, or lock them down and not be dependent on the upstream nf-core/modules if versions need to stay out of sync. It's just a patch to the `environment.yml`.

<!-- TODO Come up with a practical example of why this might happen-->
