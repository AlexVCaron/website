We are extremely happy to see this [paper](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/6/2/lqae031/7658070) out describing the changes and
updates to [nf-core/sarek](https://github.com/nf-core/sarek/), the DNA variant calling pipeline, in the last several years.

In 2020 we embarked on the journey of rewriting the whole pipeline in DSL2. One of the major motivations was to bring down
cloud computing costs and generally reduce storage space and computational resources. Overall, we reduced computational
costs on AWS (last summer, using spot instances) by 70% to about $20 from FASTQs to annotated VCFs using Strelka, Manta, and VEP.

But first an overview - no nf-core pipeline without a metro map:

We ditched BAM format where possible and switched to CRAM saving us 4x work storage space.

The `splitFastq()` operator was replaced by a FastP process to split the Fastq files before alignment (default 12)plus replacing trimgalore! for read trimming, and changed the default grouping of the intervals for BQSR to 21 reducing storage space another 4x and speeding up processing

    <Image src={dataflow} alt="Evaluation of FastP usage and different interval group sizes for BQSR" height="300" />

We added new tools: BwaMem2 and DragMap for alignment, more variant callers (DeepVariant, HaplotypeCaller Joint Calling &
Single Sample variant recalibration, CNVKit, Tiddit), and more annotation possibilities.

Some tools were replaced: Trimming is now done with FastP, CRAM quality control with Mosdepth. For convenience we added more
quality control options: When starting from variant-calling directly, all input files can now run through the alignment QC steps.

We benchmarked the germline track with Illumina, MGI, and BGI GiaB samples and the somatic track with Seq2C samples.
We recently joined the NCBench effort to continuously validate the pipeline on release.
