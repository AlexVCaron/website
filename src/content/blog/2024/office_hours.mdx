# nf-core office hours

Slack serves as an outstanding platform for asynchronous collaboration.
Nonetheless, there are moments when engaging in live discussions about your code proves beneficial.
We are thrilled to introduce _nf-core office hours_, weekly drop-in sessions designed for nf-core developers seeking an opportunity to connect and chat.

# What you can expect

Office hours will be most useful for “advanced beginners” - people who have grasped the fundamentals of writing nextflow pipelines, and are now trying to make the leap to designing, coding, and contributing nf-core components and pipelines.
However, regardless of what stage you are at, if you think that spending some time talking about developing with nf-core sparks your interest, then the office hours might be just what you're looking for!

In these sessions, some of the nf-core maintainer team and other seasoned community members will be available to engage in discussions about your code.
They will hang out in Gather during designated hours every week, ready to provide guidance and insights into your nf-core code development.

Office hour sessions won't be structured.
Some example things I thinks that might be discussed could help with include:

-   A specific concept doesn't make sense and you'd like to talk it over
-   You're working on a component or pipeline, you're stuck, and you'd like to get unstuck
-   You'd like to swap code reviews
-   You're excited about code and your colleages are tired of hearing about it

# Schedule

We are starting a 10 week trial of _nf-core office hours_ while we evaluate the program.
We will focus on the European and American time zones initially.

-   TBD
-   TBD
-   TBD

After the trial we will collect feedback and evaluate if and how we might improve it.
