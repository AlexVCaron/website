## New pipeline onboarding

This documents the steps that need to be performed when a new pipeline is accepted via #new-pipelines

1. [ ] Core: Check proposal has received approval on #new-pipelines from either:
    - at least 2 members of core team
    - at least 1 member of core team and 1 member of maintainers team
2. [ ] Core: Check name follows [pipeline naming guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/workflow_name)
3. [ ] Core: Make slack channel with approved name
4. [ ] Core: Ask developer to join #pipeline-maintainers
5. [ ] Core/Dev: Make git repository with nf-core create and push to GitHub
6. [ ] Core/Dev: Transfer repository to nf-core GitHub organisation and delete repository on local machine
7. [ ] Core/Dev: Sync the nf-co.re pipelines page by manually triggering the GitHub action (website repo > actions > build json files and md-cache > Run workflow > from main)

## Uploading test data to s3 bucket

Uploading full-test AWS files for a pipeline to S3 bucket information:

-   [ ] Check Valid test data that can be uploaded:
    - [ ] Small input data that maybe flaky when downloaded from other repositories
            e.g. Max of 10GB for the total across all files
    - [ ] Very large files that cannot be reduced or subset
-   [ ] When creating the pipeline directory in the bucket, use the 'Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) option

## Activating Zenodo archiving of a new pipeline

Instructions for setting up Zenodo DOIs.
Anyone who is in the nf-core organization can do this!

Before release:

1. [ ] Sign up with Zenodo and log in
2. [ ] Make sure you have connected your github (Settings -> GitHub -> Connect Account)
3. [ ] Once connected, go back to Settings -> GitHub
4. [ ] Flip switch against all nf-core _pipeline_ repositories in the list of repositories to 'On' (including the one that you want to assign)
    - Might as well do this for all (active) pipelines you see, as DOIs won't be assigned until release anyway
    - Some will not activate (e.g. nf-core/exoseq) as they are archived!
5. [ ] Tell pipeline developer to make a release

Post release:

1. [ ] Go to Zenodo and find the repository of interest on the list repositories under Settings -> Github
2. [ ] Click through to the release's Zenodo 'record' page
3. [ ] Scroll down and look on the right-hand side of the page for the 'Communities' box, submit the record to the nf-core community
4. [ ] Scroll down and again look on the right-hand side of the page for the 'Versions' box
5. [ ] Copy the 'cite all versions by using the DOI ' DOI (_not_ the specific release!)
6. [ ] On the master branch of the pipeline's repository, edit the following files:
    - **README.md**: Zenodo Badge at the top, and 'If you use this pipeline cite:' at the bottom (make sure to uncomment this section too)
    - **Nextflow.config**: manifest's DOI entry
    - Commit with something like 'Add Zenodo ID after first release'

## Adding new community member to the GitHub organisation

Anyone can request to join the nf-core GitHub organisation via #github-invitations.

1.  [ ] Check they have a reasonable to join (clearly not spam)
2.  [ ] Invite via https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams
3.  [ ] Make sure to do team 'contributors' https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams/contributors
4.  [ ] Press ✅ on their message in #github-invitations
