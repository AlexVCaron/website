## New pipeline onboarding

Instructions for nf-core pipeline approval:

1. [ ] Core: Check proposal has received approval in #new-pipelines from either:
    - at least two members of the core team
    - at least one member of the core team and one member of the maintainers team.
2. [ ] Core: Verify that the pipeline name follows the [pipeline naming guidelines](/docs/guidelines/pipelines/workflow_name).
3. [ ] Core: Create a slack channel with approved pipeline name.
4. [ ] Core: Ask the developers to join #pipeline-maintainers channel.
5. [ ] Core/Dev: Create the git repository using `nf-core pipelines create` and push it to GitHub.
6. [ ] Core/Dev: Transfer the repository to nf-core GitHub organisation and delete the repository on local the machine/user account.
7. [ ] Core/Dev: Sync the nf-co.re pipelines page by manually triggering the GitHub action (website repo -> actions -> build json files and md-cache -> Run workflow -> from main).

## Uploading test data to s3 bucket

Instructions for uploading full-test AWS files for a pipeline to a S3 bucket:

-   [ ] Check Valid test data that can be uploaded:
    -   [ ] Small input data that maybe unreliable when downloaded from other repositories
            (e.g., limit total file size to a maximum of 10GB across all files)
    -   [ ] Very large files that cannot be reduced or subsetted.
-   [ ] When creating the pipeline directory in the S3 bucket, select the 'Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)` option.

## Activating Zenodo archiving of a new pipeline

Instructions for setting up Zenodo DOIs.

:::note
It's recommended that a core team member transfers the DOI to the nf-core Zenodo community.
:::

Before release:

1. [ ] Sign up on Zenodo and log in.
2. [ ] Connect your Github account (Go to Settings -> GitHub -> Connect Account).
3. [ ] Once connected, go back to Settings -> GitHub
4. [ ] Enable Zenodo archiving for all nf-core pipeline repositories by toggling the switch to `On` (including the one you want to assign).
    - It’s a good idea to enable this for all active pipelines, as DOIs will only be assigned upon release.
    - Note: Some repositories (e.g., nf-core/exoseq) may not activate as they are archived.
5. [ ] Inform the pipeline developers to make a release.

Post release:

1. [ ] Go to Zenodo and find the relevant repository in Settings -> Github.
2. [ ] Click through to the Zenodo 'record' page for the release.
3. [ ] On the record page, scroll down and look on the right-hand side and find the `Communities` box. Submit the record to the nf-core community.
4. [ ] Scroll down and again on the right-hand side of the page for the `Versions` box, copy the DOI for 'cite all versions by using the DOI ' (_not_ the specific release DOI).
5. [ ] Update the following files on the master branch of the pipeline repository:
    - **README.md**: Add the Zenodo Badge at the top and update the 'If you use this pipeline cite:' section at the bottom (make sure to uncomment this section too).
    - **Nextflow.config**: Update the manifest block to include the DOI.
    - Commit these changes with a message like 'Add Zenodo ID after first release'.

## Adding new community member to the GitHub organisation

Anyone can request to join the nf-core GitHub organisation via the #github-invitations channel.

1.  [ ] Verify the request is reasonable (i.e., clearly not spam).
2.  [ ] Send an invitation via [nf-core github teams](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams)
3.  [ ] Add them to the [nf-core contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams/contributors)
4.  [ ] Respond to the request on slack by reacting with ✅ on their message in #github-invitations channel (so they get their acceptance instructions).

## Updating online bingo cards

Before each hackathon, we need to update the [bingo cards](https://nfcore-bingo.web.app/) to ensure they remain current.

1. [ ] Get the outreach google account credentials from `@core-team`
2. [ ] Log into the Firebase Dashboard: https://console.firebase.google.com/
