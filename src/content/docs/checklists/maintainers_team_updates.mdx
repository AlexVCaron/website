Roughly once a year we review the maintainers team to ensure we have sufficient capacity to keep up with the community activity. 

The following steps are what the maintainers team leads need to do during the review. 

1. [ ] Ask who wants to step down
2. [ ] Ask for nominations in maintainers meeting, discuss and approve
3. [ ] Ask nominees
4. [ ] Once accepted, add to [#team-maintainers](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C043UU89KKQ) (and remove alumni/extras)
5. [ ] Once accepted, make PRs to add/move to alumni members and merge in:
   - [ ] Website > Governance page
   - [ ] Maintainers minutes blog announcement
8. [ ] Announce on [#announcements](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE6P95170)
9. [ ] Update team lists:
    - [ ] [Github](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/teams/maintainers)
    - [ ] Slack
10. [ ] Add new maintainers to google calendar(s)
