The nf-core community maintains a centralised repository of shared Nextflow modules.
These are software tool process definitions that can be imported into any pipeline.
This allows multiple pipelines to use the same code for share tools and gives a greater degree of granulairy and unit testing.

The nf-core DSL2 modules repository is at <https://github.com/nf-core/modules>
