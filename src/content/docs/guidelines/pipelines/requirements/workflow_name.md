All nf-core pipelines should be lower case and without punctuation.
This is to maximise compatibility with other platforms.

We prefer that names are self-descriptive towards the data or analysis type the pipeline will be using or performing.
Users of the pipeline should be able to get a good idea of what the pipeline does from just the name.
For this reason, names must not clash with different data or analysis types.

Names must be approved by the nf-core community [(`#new-pipelines`)](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE6SDEDAA).

Please refer to your pipeline with the `nf-core` prefix in written materials, for example `nf-core/yourpipeline`.
