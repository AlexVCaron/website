## Introduction

This page includes step-by-step guides, walkthroughs, and general long-form introductions to various aspects of nf-core, aimed for brand-new users or developers who are not sure where to start.

- [Introduction to running nf-core pipelines](/docs/usage/tutorials/nf_core_usage_tutorial)
  - This walkthrough gives an overview of how to use nf-core pipelines. It is in a workshop format with practical exercises, and gives you all the basic information you need to get yourself up-and-running with nf-core pipelines.
- [Adding your institution to the community](/docs/usage/tutorials/institution.md)
  - If you haven't found your institution on the [community pages](/contributors), please add yourself. Just a few lines of YAML and your logos needed.
- [Step-by-step guide to writing an nf-core institutional profile](/docs/usage/tutorials/step_by_step_institutional_profile.md)
  - This guide goes through step-by-step on what you need to consider, and how to write a config file, when contributing an nf-core institutional profile for your particular cluster.
- [Tutorial: nf-core contributor overview](/docs/contributing/tutorials/nf_core_contributing_overview.md)
  - An overview of how to contribute to nf-core, starting with installing nf-core tools, creating a new pipeline using the nf-core template, adding modules to a pipeline, and releasing a pipeline.
- [Tutorial: Create a DSL2 Module](/docs/contributing/tutorials/dsl2_modules_tutorial.md)
  - In this tutorial we will see how to create a new module for the nf-core modules repository. As an example, we will create a module to execute the FastqToBam function of the FGBIO suite of tools.
- [Tutorial: Using nf-core components outside nf-core](/docs/contributing/tutorials/unofficial_pipelines.md)
  - In some cases you may wish to follow parts nf-core best practices for your own pipeline. This tutorial describes how to use nf-core code without making official nf-core pipelines.
- DSL2 template code walkthrough:
- [Tutorial: Adding Modules to Pipelines](/docs/contributing/tutorials/adding_modules_to_pipelines.md)
  - Quick reference of the steps needed to add a new module to a pipeline.
- [Tutorial: Using nf-core/configs outside nf-core](/docs/contributing/tutorials/nf_core_configs_outside_nf_core.md)
  - Guidance on how to use nf-core's centralised institutional configs in your own custom workflows.
