# Introduction

The Neuroimaging SIG aims to accelerate the integration of Nextflow and nf-core in all fields of neuroimaging. Its first goal is to put in place guidelines and standards tailored for neuroimaging. Its second is to create educational content and a common base of tailored modules and subworkflows for neuroimaging purposes, in order to streamline the integration of Nextflow and nf-core pipelines in neuroimaging, and of new researchers in the nf-core community.

To do so, the SIG need to indentify :
1. Common use-cases and challenges of doing Neuroimaging with Nextflow and nf-core
2. Educational requirements to get the Neuroimaging field in line with Nextflow and nf-core
3. Nextflow and nf-core practices that need to translate to Neuroimaging
4. Good practices in Neuroimaging that could or need to translate to Nextflow and nf-core

# Activities

Initial activities will involve recrutement of researchers from other Neuroimaging fields into the SIG, and a monthly meeting to put in place the required knowledge. Other activities will be added once a first meeting has taken place.
