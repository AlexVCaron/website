# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core/differentialabundance

nf-core/differentialabundance is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse data represented as matrices, comparing groups of observations to generate differential statistics and downstream analyses, see more [here](https://nf-co.re/differentialabundance/1.4.0). In this weeks bytesize, Jonathan Manning ([pinin4fjords](https://github.com/pinin4fjords)) will show us the ins and outs of the nf-core/differentialabundance pipeline.
