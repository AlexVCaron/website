If you need to run nf-core pipelines on offline systems, it is required to first download the pipeline files before manually transfering them to your system. The `nf-core download` command will download both the pipeline code and the institutional nf-core/configs files. Learn more about `nf-core download` with Matthias Zepper ([@MatthiasZepper](https://github.com/MatthiasZepper)) in this weeks bytesize talk.
