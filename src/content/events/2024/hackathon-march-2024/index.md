# Online: Gather

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather. If you have never used Gather before we have [a bytesize video](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) from the March 2022 hackathon that will help you to get started.

# Local sites

In March 2023 we tried something new: distributed local sites.
It was a massive success, with many people volunteering to organise local groups and great feedback all around.
In 2024 we hope to replicate and build on that success! üöÄ

Hacking in person is a lot of fun. Although the hackathon is online, to get the best of both worlds, we are encouraging everyone to create local sites where people can gather to hack together. Be it with your group, institute, city, or region, local sites will be a lot of fun!

> Reminder: Even if you are attending a local site you will still join everyone online in Gather.
