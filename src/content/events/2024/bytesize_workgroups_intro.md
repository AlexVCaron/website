# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core Work Groups

Nf-core is introducing a new way to find people that are interested in the same subject you are: Work Groups. They are meant to bring together developers from adjacent fields to learn from and encourage each other. Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels)) is giving us an overview of all things nf-core Work Groups.
