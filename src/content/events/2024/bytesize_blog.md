# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core blog

Since the 12th of January 2024, we have an official nf-core blog at [nf-co.re/blog](https://nf-co.re/blog). While it will be used by the core team and developers to update the community about ongoing project, it is also a great way for you to get active! Matthias Hörtenhuber ([@mashehu](https://github.com/mashehu)) will introduce us to the vision for the brand new and shiny blog and how you can contribute to it.
