Following the latest `TEMPLATE` update, the underlying logic from the pipelines will be slightly reorganised.
The `lib/` folder is gone, and we will be using subworkflows instead.
This should allow for a more modular and flexible codebase, which will allow for more frequent updates and easier maintenance.

Harshil Patel ([@drpatelh](https://github.com/drpatelh)) is giving us an overview of all the changes and how to adapt to the new structure.
