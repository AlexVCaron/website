This week Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) will show us how to modify any website using the Tamper Monkey browser plugin.

The rough outline of the talk will be:

* Showing how the browser developer console can be used to understand how web pages are built
* Editing a live web page locally in the developer console
* A walk through of writing a custom Tamper Monkey userscript from scratch to modify how a given web page renders
* How to horrify your coworkers by messing with their browser whilst they go for a coffee
