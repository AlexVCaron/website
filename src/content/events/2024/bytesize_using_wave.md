Wave is a container provisioning service integrated with Nextflow. With Wave, you can build, upload, and manage the container images required by your data analysis workflows automatically and on-demand during pipeline execution. Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) will show us in this bytesize the different ways of how wave can be utilized.
