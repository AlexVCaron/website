For the first meeting of the #animal-genomics special interest group, we are honored to announce Christa KÃ¼hn, president of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, BovReg project coordinator and former coordinator of EuroFAANG RI, as the inaugural speaker. Christa is well-known in the Bovine field for her important contributions to animal genetics. Her talk will be followed by a round table where the structure of the series will be announced and discussed with the participants.
