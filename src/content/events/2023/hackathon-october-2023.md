# Welcome

Join us in-person or online for the October 2024 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2023**_ in Barcelona, Spain üá™üá∏. You can find out more information about the summit at <https://summit.nextflow.io>.

In addition to the in-person event, we will endeavour to run a hybrid option online in [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

This hackathon is not meant to be a training event but aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of nextflow and/or nf-core.
If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there will be free online workshops spanning all global timezones in September.
