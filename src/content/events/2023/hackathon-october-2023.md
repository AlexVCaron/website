# Welcome

Join us in-person or online for the October 2023 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2023**_ in Barcelona, Spain üá™üá∏. You can find out more information about the summit at <https://summit.nextflow.io>.

In addition to the in-person event, we will endeavour to run a hybrid option online in [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

This hackathon is not meant to be a training event but aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of Nextflow and/or nf-core.
If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there will be free online workshops spanning all global timezones in September.
For more information and the training registration link, see the [Community Foundational Nextflow Training](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-basic-2023) and [Community Advanced Nextflow Training](https://nf-co.re/events/2023/training-sept-2023) pages.

# Groups

To keep work and discussion during the hackathon manageable, we will organise everyone into groups. You are free to change groups as you wish during the hackathon.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single GitHub project board (we‚Äôll post a link to here closer to the time). There will be a separate tab for each group where will have collated a list of relevant issues.
# Venue: Hotel SB Glow

The in-person hackathon will be taking place at Hotel SB Glow.

More information about this venue can be found the the [Nextflow Summit website](https://summit.nextflow.io/).
