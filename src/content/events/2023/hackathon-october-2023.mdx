# Welcome

In addition to the in-person event, we will run a free virtual option online in [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

It is aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of Nextflow and/or nf-core.

If you're interested in learning Nextflow and nf-core, there are free online workshops in September.

# Groups

To keep things manageable everyone will be organized into groups.
You are free to change groups at any time during the hackathon.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/47).
There is a separate tab for each group that will have a list of relevant issues for you to work on.

## Meta groups

These groups are here to support anyone who may need help getting started at the hackathon.
They are not intended for focussed task-specific work.

<HackathonGroup title="Beginners" leaders={{
    'mribeirodantas': 'Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas',
    'abhi18av': 'Abhinav Sharma',
    'FranBonath': 'Franziska Bonath'
}}>
    For this hackathon, we will  have no designated beginners group but will instead
    have a "beginners table" **on the first day**.
    You're welcome to join to get help on how to contribute to open-source,
    and to meet other community contribution beginners.

    Please note that attendees are expected to know the basics of building with Nextflow.
</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Online" leaders={{
    'yuukiiwa': 'Yuk Kei',
    'louperelo': 'Louisa Perelo'
}}>
    If you're feeling lost in Gather.town, or just want to hang out with other online attendees,
    look out for Yuk Kei and Louisa. They'll be able to steer you in the right direction and
    get you started with one of the project groups.
</HackathonGroup>

## Project groups

<HackathonGroup title="Pipelines" color="#bf4b8a" proj_url="https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/47/views/4" leaders={{

    The pipelines group will focus on any pipeline-related work.
    This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline,
    or an entirely new pipeline
    (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon,
    following [our guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/adding_pipelines#before-you-start)).
    These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test within pipelines
    - Adding new functionality to existing pipelines
    - Updating pipelines to use the latest nf-core template, via template syncs

    The modules group welcomes anyone who wants to work on current or new modules + subworkflows

    'nvnieuwk': 'Nicolas Vannieuwkerke'
}}>
    The nf-core website and central tooling are always being improved.
