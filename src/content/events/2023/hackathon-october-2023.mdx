# Groups

To keep things manageable everyone will be organized into groups.
You are free to change groups at any time during the hackathon.

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/47).
There is a separate tab for each group that will have a list of relevant issues for you to work on.

## Meta groups

<HackathonGroup title="Beginners">
    For this hackathon, we will  have no designated beginners group but will instead
    have a "beginners table" on the first day.

    Please note that attendees are expected to know the basics of building with Nextflow.
</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Online">
    Group leads reach out to specific sub-groups for contacts.
</HackathonGroup>

## Project groups

<HackathonGroup title="Infrastructure" leaders={{'mashehu':'Matthias H√∂rtenhuber', 'mirpedrol':'J√∫lia Mir Pedrol'}}>
    The nf-core website and central tooling are always being improved.
    If you enjoy working with python or want to do some web development
    (mainly CSS and javascript - we are using astrojs+svelte), join the infrastructure group!
</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Pipelines">
    The pipelines group will focus on any pipeline-related work.
    This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline,
    or an entirely new pipeline
    (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon,
    following [our guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/adding_pipelines#before-you-start)).
    These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.
</HackathonGroup>


<HackathonGroup title="Modules & Subworkflows">
    The modules group welcomes anyone who wants to work on current or new modules + subworkflows
    at [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).
</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Nextflow backbone">
    New for 2023!
