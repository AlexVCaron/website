# Welcome

Join us from September 6-8 2023 for the Community Nextflow & nf-core Training event!

The Community Nextflow and nf-core Training is entirely virtual and free and will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow and nf-core. While the training will offer something for all skill levels it will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community.

# Accessing the streams

To make the workshops available to everyone they will be streamed on the [Foundational training playlist on the nf-core YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3xpfTVZLcNiLFLiDqk_H5b3TBwvgO_-W).

# Schedule

Training sessions will be available from 3 pm (CEST) each day. Each session will be approximately 2.5 - 3 hours and will include a short break.

The training will consist of two days of Nextflow and one day of nf-core training. The material covered will be very similar to what has already been shown in [previous community training events](https://www.youtube.com/@nf-core/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2).
