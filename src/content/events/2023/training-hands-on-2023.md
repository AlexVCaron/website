# Welcome

Join us from September 20 2023 for the Hands-on Nextflow & nf-core Training event!

The Hands-on Nextflow training is entirely virtual and free and will demonstrate how to build a pipeline with Nextflow. While the training will offer something for all skill levels it will be especially useful for those who have already completed the foundational Nextflow training.

# Accessing the streams

To make the workshops available to everyone they will be streamed on the [nf-core YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/nf-core).

# Schedule

This training session will be available from 3 p.m. (CEST) on September 20th. This session will be approximately 2 hours.

## Asking questions

Questions can be asked in the Slack channels created for this event. Community volunteers will monitor these channels and will answer your questions as quickly as they can. You can join the nf-core Slack [here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack).
