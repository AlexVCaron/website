# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: Converting pytest modules to nf-test

The last hackathon was under the unoffical theme of "adopting nf-test". Adam ([@adamrtalbot](https://github.com/adamrtalbot)) and Sateesh ([@sateeshperi](https://github.com/sateeshperi)) are going to show in this bytesize how to convert a pytest module to nf-test. Although this may be soon a feature of future nf-core/tools, you will get a look into the steps required to do so on your own!
