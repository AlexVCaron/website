# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core/pangenome

nf-core/pangenome is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for pangenome graph construction. The pipeline renders a collection of sequences into a pangenome graph with the goal to to build a graph that is locally directed and acyclic while preserving large-scale variation. Simon Heumos ([@subwaystation](https://github.com/subwaystation)) is going to show us the ins and outs of this pipeline.
