# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: Bytesize: The Art of a Minimal Example

We all know how difficult it is to debug a complicated pipeline, but Phil ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) is here to help! In this weeks bytesize talk, he will show us how to debug with a minimal reproducible example - a tiny pipeline that exhibits the buggy behavior.
