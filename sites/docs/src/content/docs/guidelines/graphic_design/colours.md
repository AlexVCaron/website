subtitle: Description which colours nf-core uses
---

The nf-core green colour is as follows:

- RGB: <span class="badge" style="background-color: rgb(36,176,100);">36,176,100</span>
- Hex: <span class="badge" style="background-color: rgb(36,176,100);">#24B064</span>

For other non-logo colours, we generally recommend the use of [Bootstrap colour palettes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/customize/color/).
For example, the dark backgrounds of the nf-core website uses the `$grey-50` colour palette.
