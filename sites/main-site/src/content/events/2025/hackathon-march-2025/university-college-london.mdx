Attendees from outside University College London **can** attend.

Main contact: Chris Wyatt ([ucbtcdr@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:ucbtcdr@ucl.ac.uk)), Fernando Duarte ([ucbtfrd@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:ucbtfrd@ucl.ac.uk))

Venue currently split across three sites at UCL (within 5 mins walk) over the three days:
24th: 188 Tottenham Ct Rd (Room 4). Capacity = 40
25th: LG04 Otto Koenigsberger & LG02 Patrick Abercrombie, Central House.  Capacity = 20
26th: 302 & 402 Tutorial Room, Bentham House.  Capacity = 15

I am still awaiting confirmation from estates that we can have these rooms. 

We have capacity for 15 attendees for 3 day participants, but for those wanting to attend for 1/2 day we have more space.
