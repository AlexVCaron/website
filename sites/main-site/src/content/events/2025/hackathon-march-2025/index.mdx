# Welcome

:::info{title="Key dates"}

:::

To get a feel for how the event will work, check out the similar style hackathons
that we held in [2023](/events/2023/hackathon-march-2023) (16 local sites, 407 attendees)
and [2024](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) (23 local sites, 466 attendees).

## Host a local site

We are now [accepting registrations](https://seqera.typeform.com/hackathon-sites) from
organizers interested in hosting local hackathon sites :tada:

Anyone is welcome to host a site: you don't need to be an expert or have prior experience with hackathons.
All you need is enthusiasm and access to a dedicated space for the duration of the event.
Any space will do: be it a meeting room for 5-10 people through to larger spaces to accommodate more.

If you have any questions, jump into the [`#hackathon-mar-2025`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C081XQ6T3M4)
channel on the [nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack) and we'll be happy to help.
