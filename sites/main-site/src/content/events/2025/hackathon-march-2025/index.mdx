# Welcome

:::info{title="Key dates"}

-   Late December 2024: Registration opens for hosting local sites

-   March 24-26 2025: Hackathon

:::

To get a feel for how the event will work, check out the similar style hackathons
that we held in [2023](/events/2023/hackathon-march-2023) (16 local sites, 407 attendees)
and [2024](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024) (23 local sites, 466 attendees).

## Host a local site

We are now [accepting registrations](https://seqera.typeform.com/hackathon-sites) from
organizers interested in hosting local hackathon sites :tada:

Anyone is welcome to host a site: you don't need to be an expert or have prior experience with hackathons.

What you'll need:

-   Access to a dedicated space for the duration of the event
-   Decent wifi and a bunch of extension cables
-   Enthusiasm!

Any space will do: be it a meeting room for 5-10 people through to larger spaces to accommodate more.

The steps to host a site are:

1. Fill in the local site registraion form below
2. Coordinate with the hackathon organisers to create a site-specific webpage on this website
3. Advertise - both locally and online
4. During the event: act as a contact point with the hackathon organisers

In previous years, Seqera has sponsored pizza.
We're not yet sure how much funding will be available in 2025 or what shape it will take,
so please don't plan around this.

If you have any questions, jump into the [`#hackathon-mar-2025` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C081XQ6T3M4)
on the [nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack) and we'll be happy to help.
