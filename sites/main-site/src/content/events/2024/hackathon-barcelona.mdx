# Welcome

Join us in person for the October 2024 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2024**_ in Barcelona, Spain and is organised jointly.
You can find out more information about the summit, venue, and other logistics at https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/.

<!-- TODO insert both cards side by side? -->

The Barcelona nf-core hackathon will be in-person only, without the hybrid / online features that we have used in other events (e.g., Gather Town).
Anyone is free to join remotely, as we will be using the same GitHub Project boards and Slack communication as usual.
However, please be aware, we won't actively be trying to run this as a hybrid event.

**Registration**: Visit the [summit registration page](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/register/). Please note that tickets are limited, so register early to avoid disappointment.

**Location**: [World Trade Center Barcelona](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fyezb8CiS11wEGAU6)

# What to expect

The nf-core hackathons are collaborative, community-driven events where participants work together on projects. <!-- TODO link to projects -->
Projects can be anything from:

    - Adding new features to existing pipelines
    - Adding and improving nf-core/modules
    - Improving the website and nf-core tooling
    - Creating entirely new pipelines
    - Discuss community initiatives
    - Work on special interest group topics
    - ...

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community. Each project has a lead
who can point you in the right direction.

We try to group people based on the types of tasks that are being tackled, so that you can work with others who have similar interests.
You can move around groups and projects throughout the event.

nf-core hackathons are not just about coding! We also have a lot of fun. We typically run things like a quiz, a bingo and have several small prizes for the winners.
In addition to small social games and contests during the event, we also have a social evening.

**Audience**: All welcome, no prior nf-core contributions needed
**Required**: Some experience with writing Nextflow code.

Beginners welcome, but please note that this is not a training event. There will be a separate [training event](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/training/) in parallel to the hackathon. We will all meet up for the social evening.

## How to connect with others

We use Slack for all communication throughout the year. Joining ahead of the hackathon gives you an opportunity to already meet
others, check discussions on hackathon projects, maybe join one already, or propose your own.

During the hackathon, most communication will happen in person, but we will use slack for important announcements.

## Where to find tasks

We collect all tasks in a project board <!-- TODO link -->

If you are not too familiar yet with the code base, a great starting point is to filter for `good first issues`.

Once you found something, get in touch with the project group (i.e. ping them on slack, find them in the room), assign yourself, and get started.

## How to contribute code

We use GitHub to collaborate on code:

    <!-- TODO link to external docs on this?-->
    1. Find a hackathon project
    2. (Discuss with the group)
    3. Assign yourself to the issue. (Create one if it is not there)
    4. Fork the repository
    5. Work on a branch in your Fork
    6. Once ready, open a PR to the parent repository

> Only assign yourself to an issue if you are ready to work on it.

## Where to find more information

    <!-- TODO add links-->
    - bytesize talks
    - tutorials

## TL;DR: Prerequisites

    <!-- TODO add links-->
    - Join the nf-core Slack
    - Join the GitHub organisation
    - Be there

# Projects

This hackathon we will use projects: smaller scoped out topics that a (small) group of people will work on.
At the end of each day, we will group the projects into categories and sum up their progress.

## Submit a new project

New projects can be proposed in the slack channel <!-- TODO link to slack channel--> with:

    - Project name
    - Lead person (can only lead one)
    - Description
    - Goal
    - Category

After a (short) community discussion, you can add your project to the list below and others can find it.

> If you are planning to propose and work on a new pipeline, please go to #new-pipelines slack channel **ahead** of the hackathon start
> and follow the proposal workflow there. (The core and maintainers team responsible for approving new pipelines are also heavily involved in the
> hackathon organisation. Proposing during the hackathon can delay any discussion around it.)

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group. If you don't know where ti find them in the room, ping the
project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.

## Project tasks

We will use a GitHub Project board to collect all tasks and their status during the hackathon.

**Project Leaders**: Add project tasks as GitHub issues to the board ahead of the hackathon. If appropriate, label them as `Good first issue`
**Project Member** : Use the project board to find issues and assign yourself, once you are ready to start working on it.

## Overview of all projects

    <!-- TODO Add a project as example -->

# Socials activities

During the hackathon, we will have light-hearted fun and games!
Special prizes are up for grabs for the winners!

_More details will be available soon._

    - quiz
    - bingo
    - socks

# Helpful resources

## Bytesize talks

There are many talks about Nextflow and nf-core on the [nf-core Bytesize playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hEYtrGXrKo&list=PL3xpfTVZLcNiF4hgkW0yXeNzr0d35qlIB&ab_channel=nf-core).
In particular, the talk about [using git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTEXDXWf4hE&list=PL3xpfTVZLcNiJTzhWPUY4HmP-YpiAcdNo&ab_channel=nf-core) in an nf-core environment may be useful.
