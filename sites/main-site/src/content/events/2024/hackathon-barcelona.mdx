# How the hackathon works

## What to expect

The nf-core hackathons are collaborative, community-driven events where participants work together on projects.

Everyone is welcome, no prior experience of nf-core contributions is needed. However, we do expect that you have some experience with writing Nextflow code.
Beginners are welcome, but this is not a training event. (There is a separate [training event](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/training/) in parallel to the hackathon.)

nf-core hackathons are not just about coding! We also have a lot of fun. We typically run things like a quiz, a bingo and have several small prizes for the winners.
In addition to small social games and contests during the event, we also have a social evening.

## Prerequisites

Before you arrive at the hackathon, please make sure that you have:

-   [Registered](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/register/)!
-   [Joined the nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join#slack)
-   [Joined the nf-core GitHub organisation](https://nf-co.re/join#github)
-   Added yourself to the [`#hackathon-oct-2024` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C07HZCK6YE4)

## Where to find tasks

We collect all tasks in a GitHub project board: https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/76

If you are not too familiar yet with the code base, a great starting point is to filter for issues labelled as `good first issue`.

Once you found something, get in touch with the project group (i.e. ping them on slack, find them in the room), assign yourself, and get started.

## How to contribute code

We use GitHub to collaborate on code:

{/* TODO link to external docs on this? */}

1. Find a hackathon project
2. Discuss with the group
3. Assign yourself to the issue. (Create one if it is not there)
4. Fork the repository
5. Work on a branch in your Fork
6. Once ready, open a PR to the parent repository

:::note
Only assign yourself to an issue if you are ready to work on it, typically one at a time.

See [Helpful resources](#helpful-resources) below for more information.

# Projects

This hackathon we will use projects: smaller scoped out topics that a (small) group of people will work on.
At the end of each day, we will group the projects into categories and sum up their progress.
Projects can be anything from:

-   Adding new features to existing pipelines
-   Adding and improving nf-core/modules
-   Improving the website and nf-core tooling
-   Creating entirely new pipelines
-   Discussion and planning community initiatives
-   Working on special interest group topics
-   ...

You can bring your own favourite topic or choose from a list of open issues in the community.
Each project has a lead who can point you in the right direction.

You don't need to commit to a single project and are free to move around groups and projects throughout the event.

## Submit a new project

New projects can be proposed in the [`#hackathon-oct-2024` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C07HZCK6YE4).
Use the [project proposal form](https://slack.com/shortcuts/Ft07HAJVNF8A/295721bac20c398d998d0fed127fe3b5) to submit an idea.
After a (short) community discussion, you can add your project to the list below and others can find it.

:::note
If you are planning to propose and work on a new pipeline, please go to [`#new-pipelines` slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE6SDEDAA)
**ahead** of the hackathon start and follow the proposal workflow there.
Proposing during the hackathon can delay any discussion around it.
:::

Once approved, project leaders should add issues issues to the [GitHub project board](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/76) ahead of the hackathon.
If appropriate, label them as `good first issue`.

## Join a project

Joining a project is as simple as turning up and getting in touch with the group.
If you don't know where to find them in the room, ping the project lead on slack.

You can move freely between projects throughout the event.
