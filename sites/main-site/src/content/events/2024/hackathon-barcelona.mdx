# Welcome

Join us in person for the October 2024 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2024**_ in Barcelona, Spain.
You can find out more information about the summit at https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/barcelona/.

The Barcelona nf-core hackathon will be in-person only, without the hybrid / online features that we have used in other events (e.g., Gather Town).
Anyone is free to join remotely, as we will be using the same GitHub Project boards and Slack communication as usual.
However, please be aware, we won't actively be trying to run this as a hybrid event.
