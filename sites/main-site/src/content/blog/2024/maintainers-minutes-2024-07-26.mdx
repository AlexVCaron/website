The 'Maintainers Minutes' aims to further give insight into the workings of the [nf-core maintainers team](/governance#maintainers)
by providing brief summaries of the monthly team meetings.



## Review of action points from last time

We got about half way through our action points from last time.

Slack channels were created for the new working groups:
    - #wg-meta-pipelines
    - #wg-modules-update
    - #wg-test-data-task-force

Please join if you want to be involved in one of those.

## More (or less) testing

JÃºlia encountered several failing tests on nf-core/crisprseq with conda and singularity. This was caused by tests only running
on docker. Moving forward we agreed that at least some tests should also be run
with `singularity` and `conda`.

We discussed several ideas. On the one hand we'd like to make sure everything works at all times, on the other hand running tons of tests
makes development slow, costs money, and is not great for the planet ðŸŒ³. As a compromise, we agreed on the following:
    - Singularity & conda tests are run on PR to master
        - Make singularity required
        - Conda optional opt-out
    - Add `workflow dispatch` button for easier manual testing

## Nf-test best practices

- (Nicolas) nf-test - a single snapshot per test vs a single snapshot per file (meaning many per test)
    - nf-test snapshot format:
    - One snapshot per file is bad!
    - All assertions in a snapshot

## Bulk updates of modules
- [x] (JÃºlia) Bulk update of modules (https://github.com/nf-core/modules/issues/5828)
- (JÃºlia) Restructuring of meta.yml (https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/5867)
 Bulk updates of modules:
    - Plan: update all modules with:
        - meta.yml -> channel structure
        - subworkflows ->
        - bio.tools identifiers
        - edam ontologies for all input/output files
        - removing defaults from conda channel
        - adding lock files
        - adding version topic channels
        - adding lint for stub tests for all modules
    - Version topic channels:
        - Maybe should be gradual overtime
        - Requries pipeline changes anyway
        - You can actually mix and match topic/non-topic channels
        - Hackathon task

## Obligatory argument

subworkflow meta.yml restrucutre:
    - Only has name of the channel, being expanded to better match the channel construct (not just files)
    - What is the name of the overall channel XYZ - NMaming stuff: now FIGHT!
        - Structure -> Accepted by majority (only Mattias unhappy)

## Versioning of modules guidelines
- [ ] Versioning module guidelines? Suggested by Arthur Gymer.
 Versioning guidelines
    - Everyone think it's a good idea
    - Linked with too tools version (but docs independent) or date?
    - Linting against tools release, but can have a `dev` version of modules guidelines?
    - Problem: linting can be against tools dev, but this is a not a stable modules version guidelines specification... could change a lot prior next tools release
    - Commits to website markdown file (too regular/fast)?
    - Major issue: how to render on website, without copying the entire markdown page every time etc
        - Also plans (although James found ðŸ¤¢) to split current guideline pages into multiple pages

## Next time
- (Mahesh) use params for ext.args: https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C049MBCEW06/p1721042240473589


## Action points

 - [ ] Matthias to attempt again to list modules on subworkflow page
 - [ ] Julia to include  singulairty/conda tests in template (deadline: next template release)
 - [ ] Nicolas to update module guidelines to say all assertions in one snapshot (definitely not one per file)
 - [ ] Mahesh to talk about params ext.args next time
 - [ ] Matthias to think about new ways of versioning module guidelines

## Upcoming discussions

Next meeting we will be reviewing the progress of the various new task-forces established during the meeting.

\- :heart: from your #maintainers team!
