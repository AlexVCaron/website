This release comes with some new features and smaller pipeline template, which shouldn't cause too much of a head-ache.
As always, if you have any problems or run into any bugs, reach out on the [#tools slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/CE5LG7WMB).

# New Features

-   Pipelines generated with nf-core/tools now come with their own Research Object (RO) Crate.
    RO Crate is an open-source standard which we use to describe our pipelines and their components in a structured way and helps with automated provenance tracking.
    More information can be found [here](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/).

    :::note
    This RO Crate describes the pipeline as a whole, not pipeline runs.
    For that kind of provenance, use the new [nf-prov plugin](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-prov), which is currently in development.
    :::

-   `nf-core pipelines download` supports now ORAS container URIs.
    Previously, you needed to use a `https://` prefix, but thanks to the work by [@MatthiasZepper](https://github.com/MatthiasZepper") we can now use the `oras://` prefix.
-   `main` as default release branch for pipelines. With this release we extended the template and tooling to support either `main` or `master` as the default branch for pipelines.
    You can follow the progress of this transition on the [pipeline health page](/pipeline_health).
-   The newly added `nf-core subworkflows patch` command allows you to patch subworkflows in the same way as you would patch modules.
