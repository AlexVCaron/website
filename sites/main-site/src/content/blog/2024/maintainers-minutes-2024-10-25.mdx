The 'Maintainers Minutes' aims to further give insight into the workings of the [nf-core maintainers team](/governance#maintainers)
by providing brief summaries of the monthly team meetings.

## Overview

In this double post, we discussed the following topics in September and October:

-   XXX SEPT POINT
-   XXX SEPT PONINT
-   [New way of passing parameters to modules within nf-test scripts](new-way-of-passing-parameters-to-modules-within-nf-test-scripts)
-   [Stalled PRs due to waiting for review](stalled-prs-due-to-waiting-for-review)
-   [Replacing monolithic `conf/modules.conf` into per module-configs](replacing-monolithic-confmodulesconf-into-per-module-configs)
-   [Modification of modules specifications regarding channels](modifications-of-modules-specifications-regarding-channels)

## New way of passing parameters to modules within nf-test scripts

Our nf-core/modules have greatly benefited from the new nf-test implementation.
However one pet peeve for many is the greatly increased number of files that now comes with each module when installing on a pipeline (>100 file pipeline PRs anyone ðŸ˜±).

Fortunately <Profile username="mahesh-panchal">Mahesh Binzer-Panchal</Profile> has made a [proof of concept](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/5706) to help reduce this number.
By moving parameters into `when` blocks within the main nf-test script file, we can drop the test-only `nextflow.config` file that many modules have ðŸŽ‰.

The proposal received unanimous approval.
Mahesh will now begin to formalise this by updating the [nf-core/modules specifications](https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/components/modules), and we can start to begin adding additional linting tests to help transfer to this system.

:::info
This system only applies to modules nf-test, and should not be used at pipeline level!

## Stalled PRs due to waiting for review

It was raised that regularly get almost-complete module PRs, but sometimes they stall because a reviewer leaves comments but does not come back to re-review.
Even if the module author receives a second approving review, but the author often (because we are nice here at nf-core) doesn't feel comfortable merging without getting the approval from the original reviewer.

After a short discussion we felt that we can add a new reviewing guideline that if all (reasonable) comments have been addressed, and an approval has been given by another reviewer, a PR should be merged after 3 months if the original reviewer did not re-review.

If the original reviewer was temporarily unable to review during this period (Which can happen!), the module can still be corrected in a follow up review.
