<p><a href="https://www.dfg.de/en/service/press/press_releases/2018/press_release_no_06/index.html">The German Funding Body (DFG)</a> has approved funding to establish 4 national high-throughput sequencing centers in Germany. The project will rely on nf-core pipelines for analyzing large-scale genomics data. Contributors from the Kiel and TÃ¼bingen sites are already actively contributing to nf-core, and the other sequencing centers in Cologne/Bonn (West German Genome Center) and the Dresden Center are in the process of joining and contributing their expertise too!</p>
