## Introduction

The nf-core project is a diverse project spread across many groups.
Here you can read how we are governed, how we are funded and how the nf-core project was started.

Please note that all nf-core community members are expected to adhere to our [code of conduct](/code_of_conduct).

## Governance

The purpose of is to formalize the governance process used by the scverse project, to clarify how decisions are made and how the various groups within our community interact.

Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community and make contributions that are in line with our guidelines. This document describes how that participation takes place, how to find consensus, and how deadlocks are resolved.

Governance groups are not fixed in size. Members will be selected based on experience and the requirements of the community as it evolves over time.

#### Steering committee

Changes that impact the project require decisions informed by extensive experience with both the project and the larger ecosystem. The steering committee include representations of the core team and outside advisors who oversee the running of the project. When the core team (including its steering committee members) fails to reach a consensus in a reasonable timeframe, the steering committee is the entity that will resolve the issue.

Responsibilities:

- Planning and making decisions about project funds

#### Core team

The core team are community members that have demonstrated a continued commitment to the nf-core community. New members will be invited to be a part of the core team based on contributions, expereince, and engamgent with the community. New members will be voted into the core team by the current core team.

Core team members will appear as organization members on the GitHub organization and have administrator access. Significant community decisions will be made by committee vote. Any decision made by the core team without a clear majority will be passed to the steering committee.

##### Responsibilities

- Day to day community decisions
- Attendance at the core team annual meeting
- Regular attendance at monthy core team meetings
- Sub-roles within the nf-core governance structure
- Community presence

## Financial Support

The vast majority of nf-core development is done as a labour of love, on a voluntary basis.
Most of all, we would like to thank all contributors (and their employers!).
You form the lifeblood of nf-core and we are eternally greatful for your time and efforts.

A number of projects and grants list nf-core as collaborators and also contribute to our community (see [_Projects we are involved with_](/community#initiatives)).
If you work with a project that would benefit from an explicit link with nf-core, please let us know.

Finally, we would specifically like to acknowledge and thank the following sponsors who help to support the project:

### Chan Zuckerberg Initiative {#czi-eoss}

<img src="/assets/img/contributors-colour/CZI.svg" alt="Chan Zuckerberg Initiative" class="float-end darkmode-image me-5 mb-5 w-25 ms-3">

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a great supporter of scientific open-source software.
We are very grateful to them for supporting nf-core and [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) with several grants through their _Essential Open Source Software for Science_ (EOSS) grants:

- [EOSS - second round](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/nextflow-and-nf-core/)
- [EOSS - fourth round](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/nextflow-and-nf-core-reproducible-workflows-for-the-scientific-community-cycle-4/)
- [EOSS - Diversity & Inclusion](https://cziscience.medium.com/advancing-diversity-and-inclusion-in-scientific-open-source-eaabe6a5488b)

Amongst other things, the CZI EOSS grant money has enabled the nf-core community to:

- Hire a dedicated coordinator / safety officer (50%)
- Hire a dedicated developer for nf-core (50%)
- Cover operational costs, such as our Slack subscription fees
- Organise events, such as hackathons
- Run organised mentorship programmes
- Hiring local community advocates from geographical areas where we currently lack representation

### Amazon Web Services {#aws}

<img src="/assets/img/contributors-colour/aws.svg" alt="Amazon Web Services" class="float-end darkmode-image me-5 mb-5 w-25 ms-3" style="max-width: 200px">

Amazon Web Services (AWS) kindly support nf-core with cloud compute credits to run each nf-core analysis pipeline with full-size benchmark datasets on every release.
You can explore and download these pipeline results under the <em class="mx-2"><i class="fab fa-aws me-2"></i> Results</em> tab on each pipeline page.

AWS also hosts the [AWS-iGenomes](https://registry.opendata.aws/aws-igenomes/) resource on the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/).
This is used by most nf-core pipelines to give free and open access to the reference genomes of over 30 species, by using a simple `--genome` key when running a pipeline.

## History of nf-core

The nf-core project came about at the start of 2018. [Phil Ewels](http://phil.ewels.co.uk/) ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) was the head of the development facility at [NGI Stockholm](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) (National Genomics Infrastructure), part of [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/) in Sweden.

The NGI had been developing analysis pipelines for use with it's genomics data for several years and started using a set of standards for each pipeline created. This helped other people run the pipelines on their own systems; typically Swedish research groups at first, but later on other groups and core genomics facilities too such as [QBIC](http://qbic.life/) in Tübingen.

As the number of users and contributors grew, the pipelines began to outgrow the SciLifeLab and NGI branding. To try to open up the effort into a truly collaborative project, [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core) was created and all relevant pipelines moved to this new GitHub Organisation.

The early days of nf-core were greatly shaped by [Alex Peltzer](https://apeltzer.github.io/) ([@apeltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer/)), [Sven Fillinger](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/research-infrastructure/quantitative-biology-center-qbic/team0/sven-fillinger/) ([@sven1103](https://github.com/sven1103/)) and [Andreas Wilm](https://andreas-wilm.github.io/) ([@andreas-wilm](https://github.com/andreas-wilm/)).
Without them, the project would not exist.
