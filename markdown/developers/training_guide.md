##Â Before I begin

A checklist of what you need to begin.

- Ask on #training about the guide you'd like to contribute.
- Make an issue on https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re/issues describing what you want to do, and assign yourself.
- GitHub account.

## How to

### Bytesize talk

There is no bytesize talk at present, but if you'd like present one, please make a suggestion on the [Slack #bytesize channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize).

### Walkthrough

#### Use this as a template.

Use this file `https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re/markdown/developers/training_guide.md` as a template to guide you.

1. If you've not done so, make a fork of the [nf-core website repository](https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re/).
2. Make a new branch from the `master` branch in your fork named after the guide you indend to submit e.g., `gitpod_training_guide`.
3. Make a copy of the `training_guide.md` with an appropriate name to use as your skeleton.

#### Add questions.

Include between 1-3 questions your guide is intended to answer.

#### Add objectives.

Objectives are intended to describe the outcomes someone reading your guide should be able to do once they've read through it.
The objectives also function as a checklist of things that should be part of the guide.

#### Add a glossary.

The glossary should define potentially unfamilar terms to a novice trying to use your guide for the first time.

#### Prepare your reader.

Make a checklist of what your reader needs to have done before they begin using this guide.

#### Add the content.

Under the `### Guide` section, add a step by step walkthrough of what you intend to demonstrate. Remember to include visual aids if it will help understanding.

Initially it is unlikely there will be a bytesize talk to link to, so leave a message that one can be contributed.
If a bytesize talk exists, then provide a link using this html under the `### Bytesize talk` section. Update the `src` URL to the correct youtube link.

```
<div class="ratio ratio-16x9">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xuNYATGFuw4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

#### Add key points.

Key points serve as a summary of what to do, and are important take home messages from the guide.

#### Add supporting links.

Provide links to where the reader can get additional support, or useful further reading.

#### Format your document.

Format your document using the `prettier` VS code extension. This can be performed either in VS code, or in Gitpod.

## Key points

- Fork the nf-core website repository, and use the `training_guide.md` as a template.
- Add questions, objectives, and glossary terms.
- Have a checklist of what is needed before one begins.
- Provide a walkthrough, and a link to the bytesize talk if one exists.
