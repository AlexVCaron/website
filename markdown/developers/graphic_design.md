title: Graphic Design
subtitle: Templates, common images, and design-related content for nf-core.
---

nf-core has a variety of recognisable images and other graphic designs for the community project. To help facilitate the identification of nf-core pipelines and related material, we provide here a variety of files that can be used for all nf-core-related content, e.g. pipeline logos, presentations, or workflow diagrams.

All files are released under various forms of 'open' licenses (see each item), meaning you can re-use and re-model (sometimes with attribution) as you see fit.

## Logo

All information for the nf-core logo can be seen at the [nf-core/logos GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/logos).

## Fonts

The font(s) typically used in nf-core graphic design (particularly logos) is [Maven Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Maven+Pro), which is released under a Open Font License (see link for details).

The exact variants of the fonts can also be seen at the [nf-core/logos GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/logos).

## Colours

The nf-core green colour is as follows:

* RGB: 36,176,100
* Hex: #24B064.

## Presentation Templates

nf-core regularly host [community events](https://nf-co.re/events), such as hackathons, and encourage training the wider bioinformatics community in creating nextflow and nf-core pipelines.s

If you wish to introduce or run training sessions to your group or network, you can access a Google Doc template **here**.

## Workflow Schematics

### Examples

It is often useful to have simplified diagrams that outline the main functionality and steps of a pipeline. We include here examples of different types from other pipelines that can be re-used and modified for your own.

Original files can be seen on the respective pipeline GitHub repositories, which can be accessed via the corresponding links.

### Components

Furthermore, there are some sub-components (such as icons) of the above example workflows made by members of the community, that are generally applicable to every pipeline. A couple of examples of these can be seen below, but are all accessible on the [nf-co.re website GitHub repository](https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re/assets/graphic_design/workflow_schematics/subcomponents), and can be re-used for your own graphics.
