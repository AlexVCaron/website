## How to develop markdown for the website

To develop code for the nfcore website (https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re) click the green Gitpod button in upper right of the screen of the repo. **Or** click the following link (https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re), which will open a Gitpod environment for the website, then sign in with either Github, GitLab or Bitbucket. 

Each page of the nf-core webpage is written in markdown. You can navigate to the Markdown files by using the explorer panel to the left hand side.

Then follow NF-CO.RE/markdown/developers to open indivudal markdown files. Then simply click on a name of the file you want to edit.

Gitpod convinienty can render the markdown within the window. In the nf-core website repo (linked earlier), open one of the markdown pages.

Next, at the top right of the text editor window, click the preview button.

This should open up in a new window the rendering of the markdown. Now you can edit your raw code and see the changes happening live in the preview. The lines should scroll down at the same time.

## Markdown

Finally, if you are editing Markdown, it is useful to activate an extension for linting. 

Click the extension button on the side panel:
