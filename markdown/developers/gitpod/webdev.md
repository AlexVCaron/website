## How to develop markdown for the website

To develop code for the nfcore website (https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re) click the green Gitpod button in upper right of the screen of the repo (once you have downloaded the browser extension). Or click the following link (https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/nf-core/nf-co.re), which will open Gitpod and ask you to sign in with either Github,GitLab or Bitbucket. 

Each page of the nf-core webpage is written in markdown. Gitpod convinienty can render the markdown within the window. In the nf-core repo (linked above), go to Explorer (left hand panel), then navigate to `./markdown/testing_with_gitpod.md`. Click on this file to open the raw code for this page. 

Next, at the top right of the markdown window, click the preview button. This should open up in a new window the rendering of the markdown. Now you can edit your raw code and see the changes happening live in the preview.
