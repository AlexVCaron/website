# Welcome

Join us from October 3-5, 2022 for the Nextflow / nf-core training event!

The training is entirely virtual and free and will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow and nf-core. The training will offer something for all skill levels but will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community, or if you are thinking about joining the [nf-core Hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/hackathon-october-2022) (October 10-12, 2022) for the first time.

# Schedule

The training will be held across three consecutive days in 2.5-hour sessions (including time for a small break and questions). Because nf-core is a global community we are making the training geographically accessible and will be holding separate sessions for different timezones:

<div class="table">
    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Timezone</th>
                <th>Session 1</th>
                <th>Session 2</th>
                <th>Session 3</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>:earth_asia: APAC (Asia-Pacific)</td>
                <td data-timestamp="1664758800" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>

                <td data-timestamp="1664931600" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>:earth_africa: EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa)</td>
                <td data-timestamp="1664798400" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>
                <td data-timestamp="1664884800" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>
                <td data-timestamp="1664971200" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>:earth_americas: AMER (North, Central, and South America)</td>
                <td data-timestamp="1664816400" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>
                <td data-timestamp="1664902800" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>
                <td data-timestamp="1664989200" data-timeformat="DD-MMM HH:mm z"></td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

Of course, if you can’t make the session in your timezone, you are welcome to attend another session at the time that works best for you.

# Prerequisites

Prior experience with Nextflow and nf-core isn’t required to attend. However, to get the most out of the training, we recommend that you are comfortable using the command line and have a basic understanding of scripting language concepts.
