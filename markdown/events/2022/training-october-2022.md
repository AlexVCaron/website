# Welcome

Join us October 3-5 for the nf-core training event!

The training is entirely virtual and free and will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow and nf-core. It will offer something for all skill levels but will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community, or if you are thinking about joining the [nf-core Hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/hackathon-march-2022) (October 10-12, 2022) for the first time.

# Schedule

The training will be held across three consecutive days in 2.5-hour sessions (including time for a small break and questions). Because nf-core is a global community we are making the training geographically accessible and will be holding separate sessions for different timezones:
- APAC (Asia and Pacific): <td data-timestamp="1664758800" data-timeformat="HH:mm z">03:00</td>
- EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa): <td data-timestamp="1664798400" data-timeformat="HH:mm z">14:00</td>
- AMER (North, Central, and South America): <td data-timestamp="1664812800" data-timeformat="HH:mm z">18:00</td>

Of course, if you can’t make the session in your time zone, you are welcome to attend another session at the time that works best for you.

# Prerequisites

Prior experience with Nextflow and nf-core isn’t required to attend the training. However, to get the most out of the training, we do recommend that you are comfortable using the command line and have a basic understanding of scripting language concepts.

The training will use a preconfigured development environment in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/). To be able to use Gitpod you will need:
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- A web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox)
- An internet connection

Please check back here soon - more details will be added to this page soon as we continue to plan the training event.
