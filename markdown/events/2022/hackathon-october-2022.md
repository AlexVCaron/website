# Welcome

Please join us for the October 2022 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2022**_ in Barcelona, Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. You can find out more information about the summit at <https://summit.nextflow.io>. Registration for the event will open in early July together with registration for the summit.

In addition to the in-person event, we will endeavour to run a hybrid option online in [gather.town](https://gather.town/).

This hackathon is not meant to be a training event but aimed at people that already have a basic understanding of nextflow and/or nf-core. For anyone interested in learning nextflow, there are going to be workshops in the week before the hackathon. As soon as we have more information, we will let you know.

# Registration

Registration will open soon. Please check back here and keep an eye out on twitter and Slack,
but in the mean time - book the dates in your calendar!

# Topic: Free-hacking!

This time around we decided to not have an official topic. You are welcome to join the hackathon and work on your own pipelines or help improve existing ones. Of course you are also welcome to add to documentation!

To keep things manageable, we will organise into groups.
You are free to change groups as you wish during the hackathon.

Since the nextflow summit is going to be held just after the hackathon, we decided to keep talks to a minimum. There will however be some workshops that include talks. We keep you posted on that!

We will coordinate our work and the issues we are working on using a single GitHub Project Board which we will post a link to here closer to the date. There will be a separate tab for each group where will have collated a list of relevant issues.

## Group 1 - Documentation

This group will focus on all kind of documentation, from pipelines themselves to modules and aid in getting started with nf-core and nextflow. We are also planning on making intro videos for each pipeline.

## Group 2 - Subworkflows

## Group 3 - Pipelines

This group will focus on any pipeline related work, this could be:

- DSL2 conversion of a pipeline
- new / improved features
- new pipelines

## Group 4 - Modules

This group will welcome anyone who wants to work on new Modules or improve already existing ones.

## Group 5 - Central tools / Website

The nf-core website needs to be improved and maintained. If this sounds like a fun task, join group 5!

# Schedule

TBD

# COVID control

To iterate the same as everyone holding in-person events, the pandemic is not over. We recommend everyone to get vaccinated and tested if possible if they intend to join the hackathon on site and ask for anyone who displays symptoms to not mingle with other participants. However, it is not feasible for us to enforce any rules, so if you are concerned about contracting Covid we ask you to consider joining remotely.
