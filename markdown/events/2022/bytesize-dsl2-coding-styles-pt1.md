# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **‚Äúnf-core/bytesize‚Äù**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

This week, Maxime Garcia ([@MaxUlysse](https://github.com/MaxUlysse)) will explain us what he thinks the perfect DSL2 coding style should be.

Come and join the ensuing discussion, it's going to be lively üòâ
