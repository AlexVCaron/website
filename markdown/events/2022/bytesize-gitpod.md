# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: gitpod.io

This week, Chris Wyatt ([@chriswyatt1](https://github.com/chriswyatt1)) will show us the functionality that comes with the addition of and how to use the .gitpod.yml as part of the pipeline template.
