## About the conference

Long-term use and uptake by the life-science community requires that workflows (as well as tools) are findable, accessible, exchanged and combined with others, and further that they are citable so that authorâ€™s credit is attributed fairly and accurately.

The work on improving the FAIRness of workflows has already started and a whole ecosystem of tools and standards has been under development to ensure the production of workflow as FAIR research products.

In this workshop we will first review the ideas of FAIR principles for computational workflows.

## Scalable, reproducible bioinformatics workflows using Nextflow & nf-core

Alex Peltzer will be giving a 10-minute lightning talk about the concept behind Nextflow and nf-core and give a short update on how approaches to enable FAIRification of nf-core workflows are currently developed.
