The nf-core hackathon in July this year will be fully virtual, so you
can contribute to nf-core and get your pipeline started
from the comfort of your homes.

Join us to get help and guidance for writing your own Nextflow pipelines
using the best practice guidelines implemented by the nf-core community
or contribute to existing pipelines and advancing the current infrastructure.
This will be a very informal event and it's great for learning,
sharing ideas and solving issues intensively.
