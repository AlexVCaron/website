## Introduction

The nf-core hackathon in July this year will be fully virtual, so you
can contribute to nf-core and get your pipeline started
from the comfort of your homes.

Join us to get help and guidance for writing your own Nextflow pipelines
using the best practice guidelines implemented by the nf-core community
or contribute to existing pipelines and advancing the current infrastructure.
This will be a very informal event and it's great for learning,
sharing ideas and solving issues intensively.

Please note that there are two separate events running in parallel:

* Nextflow training
  * Mornings - organised through [DKFZ](https://dkfz.de)
  * Read more on the [DKFZ event portal](https://indico.dkfz.de/event/225/)
  * Free to attend!
  * Places are limited to 30 external people
* nf-core hackathon
  * [**Register here**](https://forms.gle/qo3USZuK2LDJAqHS9)
  * Afternoons (mornings too if you want) - organised by nf-core community
  * Free to attend!
  * No limit on attendance, everyone welcome

All presentations for both the training and hackathon will be live-streamed
to YouTube and archived there.

## Hackathon registration

**Please register to the nf-core hackathon through this google form:
[https://forms.gle/qo3USZuK2LDJAqHS9](https://forms.gle/qo3USZuK2LDJAqHS9)**

Registration is free and non-binding. This helps us to organise the event:
numbers of people, experience and interests allow us to prepare working groups
and ensure that presentations are as relevant as possible.

We are hoping to send a few goodies in the post to everyone who registers,
so remember to fill in your postal address!

Presentations will be run using Zoom and live-streamed to YouTube,

will be handled in dedicated channels in the nf-core Slack organisation.

details or if you have questions, please post a message in the nf-core Slack.
