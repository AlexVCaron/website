## Introduction

The nf-core hackathon in July this year will be fully virtual, so you
can contribute to nf-core and get your pipeline started
from the comfort of your homes.

Join us to get help and guidance for writing your own Nextflow pipelines
using the best practice guidelines implemented by the nf-core community
or contribute to existing pipelines and advancing the current infrastructure.
This will be a very informal event and it's great for learning,
sharing ideas and solving issues intensively.

Please note that there are two separate events running in parallel:

* Nextflow training
  * Mornings - organised through [DKFZ](https://dkfz.de)
  * Read more on the [DKFZ event portal](https://indico.dkfz.de/event/225/)
  * Free to attend!
  * Places are limited to 30 external people
* nf-core hackathon
  * Afternoons (mornings too if you want) - organised by nf-core community
  * Free to attend!
  * No limit on attendance, everyone welcome

All presentations for both the training and hackathon will be live-streamed
to YouTube and archived there.

## Hackathon registration

Please register to the nf-core hackathon through this google form:
[https://forms.gle/qo3USZuK2LDJAqHS9](https://forms.gle/qo3USZuK2LDJAqHS9)

Registration is free and non-binding. This helps us to organise the event:
numbers of people, experience and interests allow us to prepare working groups
and ensure that presentations are as relevant as possible.

We are hoping to send a few goodies in the post to everyone who registers,
so remember to fill in your postal address!

## Schedule

The Hackathon will be held on the same dates as a
[parallel Nextflow workshop](https://indico.dkfz.de/event/225/timetable/#all.detailed).

Every day at 13:00 CEST there will be a webinar followed by a Q+A session.
After this, a catch-up of the hackathon progress will be held.

* **Monday** - Introduction to nf-core, tutorial on how to run pipelines
* **Tuesday** - Feature: nf-core pipelines for common data types
* **Wednesday** - Data management solutions by Elin Kronander
* **Thursday** - Tutorial on nf-core tools and guidelines
* **Friday** - Future directions: Nextflow DSL2 and nf-core modules

A remote Pub Quiz  will be held on Thursday 17:00-19:00 CEST.
