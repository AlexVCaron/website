Our October hackathon is two weeks away! Registration is now closed, but keep an eye on your inbox if you've signed up, you will be hearing from us soon!

There will be a lot of firsts at this event. We are in the process of working out details to make it as geographically accessible as we can. In addition, we will be experimenting with a group programming session on writing and contributing to nf-core modules for a limited number of participants. Our mentors, based around the world will be connecting with a small group of mentees who are also based in different countries!

This is a fair amount of work, and we want to ensure that you have a productive and fun event. So stay tuned.

Our primary focus for this hackathon will be the conversion of nf-core pipelines from DSL1 to DSL2. The main objectives of this hackathon will be adding nf-core modules and rewriting existing pipelines to the new Nextflow language format. We are currently shortlisting the pipelines for the purpose and we will have more information for you on the project boards we share prior to the event.

Thanks for signing up and see you soon!
