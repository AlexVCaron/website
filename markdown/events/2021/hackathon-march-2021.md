### Hackathon projects

Work within the hackathon will be loosely gathered into projects.
More details to come, but so far our idea is to work in the following areas:

* **DSL2 / modules**
  * DSL2 pipeline conversion (specific pipelines)
  * Writing modules for specific tools
  * DSL2 module code linting and tests
  * DSL2 module template
* **Contribute to a pipeline**
  * Syncing nf-core template to pipelines
  * Work on specific pipelines (e.g. sarek, scrna)
* **Framework tools**
  * Sample sheet standardisation (helper tools / website launch /  PEP)
  * RefGenie
* **Documentation**
  * Configs
  * Website docs overhaul
