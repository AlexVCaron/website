# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for an episode of our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize 6: DSL2 - Using modules in a pipeline

will present: _**DSL2 - Using modules in a pipeline.**_

This talk will describe how to use DSL modules when writing an nf-core pipeline - both custom
(`local`) modules, centralised from nf-core/modules and subworkflow files.
