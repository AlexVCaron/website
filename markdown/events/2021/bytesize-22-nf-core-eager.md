# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for a special pipeline-focussed episode of our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize 22: nf-core/eager

This week, James Fellows Yates ([@jfy133](https://github.com/jfy133/)) will tell us all about the nf-core/eager pipeline.

nf-core/eager is one of the largest and/or most complex nf-core pipelines. It is a best practise (meta)genomics primarily aimed at (but not limited to) processing ancient DNA. This talk will:
* Give an overview of the pipeline.
* Discuss the impact of the particularlities of ancient DNA.
* Cover some of the challenges and solutions encountered when writing this pipeline.
