# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for an episode of our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation.
Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize 13: Tuning pipeline performance

This week, Gisela Gabernet ([@ggabernet](http://github.com/ggabernet/)) will present: _**Tuning pipeline performance**_.

This will cover:

* In-depth analysis of computational resource usage after a pipeline run
* How to take that back into a custom config to make it more efficient

The talk will be presented on Zoom and live-streamed on YouTube.
