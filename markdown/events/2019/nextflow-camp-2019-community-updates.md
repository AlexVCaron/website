Now in its second year, the nf-core community continues to develop at a rapid pace.
More and more pipelines are being added to the list of stable releases, and the suite of framework tools continues to grow.
In this talk I will describe recent updates from the nextflow nf-core community - what's new with pipelines, best-practices, tips & tricks and the nf-core companion tools.
