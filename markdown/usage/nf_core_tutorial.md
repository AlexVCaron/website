## Abstract

The _nf-core_ community provides a range of tools to help new users get to grips with nextflow - both by providing complete pipelines that can be used out of the box, and also by helping developers with best practices. Companion tools can create a bare-bones pipeline from a template scattered with `TO-DO` pointers and CI with linting tools check code quality. Guidelines and documentation help to get nextflow newbies on their feet in no time. Best of all, the _nf-core_ community is always on hand to help.

In this tutorial we discuss the best-practice guidelines developed by the _nf-core_ community, why they're important and give insight into the best tips and tricks for budding nextflow pipeline developers.
